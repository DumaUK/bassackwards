! Warning: This code is very old and has not been maintained for a long time.
You probably do not want to use this anymore.

== Notice ==

This small script is hardly documented and I am really sorry for that. When I have time I will come back and refactor my code plus add all the necessary comments.


== What is that? ==

This small python script allows you to use your guitar hero controller to play pc speaker sounds. Really geeky and basically just a funny friday evening project.

If you are interested in it, you can take the code and actually make it do something useful.
